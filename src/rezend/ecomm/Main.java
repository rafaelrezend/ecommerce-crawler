/**
 * This application contains a web crawler that fetches every link from a
 * reference website. Links are processed in parallel so that those that
 * corresponds to product page are extracted and have their data stored to a
 * MySQL database. Products' price are exhibit as graphics. Therefore, an OCR
 * process is applied to extract the values.
 * 
 * Since it depends on OCR to obtain the relevant data, the success rate depends
 * on the quality of the graphics representing the values. This way, the
 * efficiency of this application cannot be fully guaranteed. Fine-tunning may
 * be required.
 * 
 * Crawler+producer and consumer are executed in different threads. They can run
 * indefinitely. However, a limit of products is set so that the application can
 * proceed retrieving and showing the stored data.
